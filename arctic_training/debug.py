    print a message without getting it interleaved with prints from other ranks.
    The lock file is the file this wrapper is defined in.
    The output order will be random per rank.

    Example:
        >>> # assuming 4 GPUs
        >>> world_size = dist.get_world_size()
        >>> rank = dist.get_rank()
        >>> printflock(f"This is a very long message from rank {rank}/{world_size}")

       This is a very long message from rank 2/4
       This is a very long message from rank 3/4
       This is a very long message from rank 1/4
